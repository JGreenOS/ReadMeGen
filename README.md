Read Me Generator with Node

This is a demonstration project of using Node.js with the Inquirer package.  

When the file is run from node index.js, the user is prompted to answer several questions including:
* Name of the project
* Description of the project
* Installation directions
* Usage information
* Software licensing
* Contribution directions
* Available tests
* Developer contact information

After the file is created, each of the answers are inserted into a markdown file, a table of contents is available and a badge for the appropriate license is displayed.
